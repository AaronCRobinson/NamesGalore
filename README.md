# NamesGalore [![RimWorld 1.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/RimWorld-1.0-green.svg?longCache=true&style=plastic)](http://rimworldgame.com/)

Adds lots of names. Uses [US Consensus Data](http://names.mongabay.com/data/surnames_A.htm). Currently only works for players with `English` set as their language.

## Features
- Adds over 150k surnames
- Adds first names for females and males
- Adds nicknames for males, females, and unisex
- Adds romanized names for most languages
- Adds ability to do "international names" which mixes up names from different cultures
- Adds ability to set nickname probability rate (adjusted default from 0.15, to 0.3)
- Adds ability to set solid name probability rate (adjusted default from 0.10, to 0.5)

## Help Wanted

Would you like to bring you culture's rich naming history into RimWorld? Then contact me about adding more names. This mod is not limited to romanized names but so far that's the only form of names I have been able to collect in any reasonable manner.

## Acknowledgements
